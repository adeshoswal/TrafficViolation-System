Problem:Identifying traffic stop line violation after employing multi-level classification on vehicular traffic and reading offenderâ€™s license plates using character recognition

The entire problem is broken down into 3 modules:
	1)Detecting and Categorising the vehicles in traffic surveillance footages
	2)Detecting and Reading the license plates on the tagged vehicles from module 3
	3)Detecting traffic violations
	
Datset used was NMC traffic footages, Poribohoron DB and kaggle Indian License plate.
Final accuracy obtained was 40%. This accuracy involved no user involvment except for setting the parallelogram in module 3.

Further this project could be extended for either imporving this accuracy measure or include other traffic violations in it.
